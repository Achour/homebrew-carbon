  # The bare symbol means "Monterey or newer" — `depends_on macos:` parses with

  app "Carbon.app"

  # Carbon is not signed with an Apple Developer ID ($99/yr, and this is a free
  # app), so a *downloaded* copy trips Gatekeeper's "Carbon is damaged and can't
  # be opened" dialog. Homebrew quarantines what it downloads, so without this
  # the cask would reproduce exactly the first-launch failure that building from
  # source avoids — clearing the flag is the same `xattr -cr` the README asks
  # .dmg users to run by hand.
  #
  # `-c` (clear all) rather than `-d com.apple.quarantine`: deleting a named
  # attribute exits non-zero on any file that doesn't carry it, which under `-r`
  # is most of them, and `system_command` would fail the install.
  #
  # `postflight_steps`, not a `postflight` block: Homebrew 7 deprecates the
  # block form and prints a warning on every install and upgrade, in the middle
  # of output that reads as a failure. A step's `run` is sandboxed, so the app
  # bundle has to be declared writable or `xattr` changes nothing.
